## Project Introduction

### RideAustin Forecasting
In 2016, the city of Austin, TX attempted to apply new regulations for hiring rideshare drivers. The industry's two giants, Uber and Lyft, felt that the regulations were unnecessary and prohibitive, so they chose to leave the city altogether. In their wake, the community created a non-profit rideshare organization, called RideAustin, to provide a similar transportation service to Austin citizens. When the regulations were overturned less than one year later, Uber and Lyft swept back into the city, serving RideAustin a swift death.

Our goal is to act as a RideAustin data scientist in 2017, using historical rideshare data to forecast our future growth (assuming no policy revisions).  The data was obtained for free through data.world, a platform which allows data collection, sharing, manipulation, and analysis.  Sign up for a free account and visit this project's [data.world workspace](https://data.world/zbutton/msda-workshop-rideaustin "RideAustin Data") to view and interact with the raw data.
